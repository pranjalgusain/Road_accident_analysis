##  Road Accident Analysis 

The project involves creating a Road Accident Analysis Dashboard in **Excel** to visualize and analyze road accident casualty data.

## 📊 Project Overview

The **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** is designed to:

- Consolidate data on total casualties, vehicle types, road types, surface conditions, and light conditions for better analysis.
- To show monthly trends, location-specific insights, and the impact of environmental factors on accidents.
- Filter data by date and location type, allowing for targeted analysis and year-over-year comparisons.


## 🎯 Project Objectives
- **Analyze casualty trends** by vehicle, road type, and conditions.
- **Identify** high-risk road environments and time periods.
- **Provide clear, visual insights** for improved road safety decisions.
- Enable interactive data filtering for deeper analysis.


## 💡 Key Insights
- **Car Accidents Dominate**: Cars account for 80% of road accidents.
- **Rural Areas at Risk**: Rural areas have more casualties than urban areas.
- **Single Carriageways Are Hazardous**: Single carriageways are the most hazardous road type.
- **Impact of Weather**: Most accidents happen on dry roads, but wet and icy surfaces remain risky.


## 📈 Strategic Recommendations
- **Vehicle-Specific Safety Campaigns**: Focus on cars and motorcycles, the most involved vehicles, with targeted driver awareness and safety measures.
- **Improve Rural Road Safety**: Invest in infrastructure and safety measures in rural areas, such as better signage, road markings, and speed limits.
- **Enhance Safety on Single Carriageways**: Introduce better traffic controls, speed regulations, and road maintenance on single carriageways to reduce accident rates.
- **Prepare for Weather Conditions**: Implement road safety measures for adverse weather conditions, including better drainage on wet roads and de-icing techniques for snow/ice-prone areas.
 
## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Excel**: Data import, transformation, visualization and dashboard creation.
